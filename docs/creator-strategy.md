   - Photo upload (up to 4 images)
   - Basic info (name, rough ingredients)
   - AI completion for description, tags, nutrition
   - Privacy toggle (My Recipes vs Community)

2. **Engagement Metrics Dashboard**

## Phase 2: Creator Recruitment (v1.2)

### Target Creators
- Food TikTokers (100k-1M followers)
- Recipe Instagram accounts
- YouTube food channels
- Food bloggers without apps

### Pitch
"Turn your recipes into a weekly meal planning experience your followers can actually use"

### Compensation Models
1. **Flat fee**: $500-2000 per creator for initial batch
2. **Performance**: $0.50 per download attributed to them
3. **Revenue share**: 10% of subscription revenue from their referrals

### Creator Requirements
- Post 5-10 recipes on MealSwipe
- TikTok/Instagram post announcing partnership
- Link in bio for 30 days
- Story/feed showing their MealSwipe meal plan

## Phase 3: Scale & Automation (v1.3)

### Self-Serve Creator Portal
- Apply to become creator
- Upload recipes independently
- Track earnings/referrals
- Automatic payouts

### Quality Scoring
- User ratings on recipes
- Completion rates
- Engagement metrics
- Auto-promote high performers

### Network Effects
- Creator leaderboards
- Recipe "trending" algorithm
- Cross-promotion between creators
- Featured creator spotlight

## Metrics to Track

### Creator Side
- Recipes uploaded per creator
- Engagement per recipe (likes, saves, meal plans)
- Follower conversion rate
- Creator retention (posting consistently)

### User Side
- Community recipe swipe rate vs API recipes
- Community recipe save rate
- Time in app per community content user
- Retention for community content consumers

### Business Side
- CAC via creator channel
- LTV of users acquired via creators
- Creator program ROI
- % of content that is user-generated vs API

## Competitive Advantage

Most recipe apps have:
- ❌ Generic database recipes
- ❌ No creator attribution
- ❌ No social proof
- ❌ No engagement loop

MealSwipe will have:
- ✅ Recipes from creators people already follow
- ✅ Personalized meal plans from favorite food TikTokers
- ✅ Bragging rights for top creators
- ✅ Real endorsement marketing

## Launch Timeline

| Phase | Features | Timeline |
|-------|----------|----------|
| v1.0 | Core app (current) | Now - Ship |
| v1.1 | Upload + basic engagement | +2 weeks |
| v1.2 | Creator recruitment (3-5 pilot) | +4 weeks |
| v1.3 | Self-serve creator portal | +8 weeks |

## Risk: Content Quality

**Problem**: Users upload bad recipes, photos, or spam

**Solutions**:
1. AI flag inappropriate content
2. Minimum engagement threshold (hide recipes with <10 swipes and <30% like rate)
3. Report system
4. Manual review for first 100 community recipes
5. Verified creator badge for established food influencers

## First Creator Outreach

**Ideal first 5 creators:**
1. Local Phoenix food blogger (test locally)
2. Meal prep TikToker (perfect use case)
3. Healthy eating Instagram account
4. Budget recipe YouTuber
5. Cultural cuisine specialist (Pho, Tacos, etc.)

**Outreach template**:
> "Hey [name], I'm building a meal planning app where your followers can actually save your recipes to their weekly meal plan. Would love to add 5 of your recipes and send you $500 + affiliate revenue. Takes 10 mins to upload. Interested?"

## Budget Estimate

- Dev time: 80-120 hours (2-3 weeks @ $0, DIY)
- First 5 creators: $2,500
- Content moderation: $500/month
- Infrastructure (storage): ~$50/month

**Total to launch v1.1**: ~$3,000 + opportunity cost of 2-3 weeks

## Recommendation

**Ship v1.0 now.** Get first users validating core mechanics.

Then, if engagement is strong:
1. Build recipe upload in 1 week (basic version)
2. Recruit 1 creator as test case
3. Iterate based on real behavior

Wait if:
- v1.0 gets 0 traction
- Users aren't saving recipes
- Core loop is broken

The creator strategy is **fuel for a working engine**, not the engine itself.
